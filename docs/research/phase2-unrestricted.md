# Phase II: the unrestricted rotational threshold

Phase I is **COMPLETE**, accepted after rounds 0–16 at
`2bda267ca0a4bd965411af36b2c89dde4c78f7c7` and finalized at
`721fd81b76a3c841389761fbe55ce917e0926a44`. Its paper and evidence are preserved.
Phase II is **OPEN**. Its goal is to determine `C_rot` for all smooth one-forms
on the original represented rotational metric class, with a determining
characterization, justified selection, a universal lower bound, sharp smooth
counterexamples above it, and the correct endpoint scope. The new results below
are a fixed-geometry prerequisite, not a threshold characterization.

## Round 0: complete-action variation

Let `K,r : ℝ → ℝ` be globally smooth, and impose the two normalized moments

\[
 \int_0^1K=2,\qquad \int_0^1xK=1.
\]
Use the **existing** area primitives and full six-entry action:

\[
 f(x)=2x-2\int_0^x(x-t)K(t)\,dt,\qquad
 f_1(x)=2-2\int_0^xK(t)\,dt,
\]
\[
 L_Kr=fr''+2f_1r'-Kr,
\]
\[
 A_K(r)=\int_0^1
 \left[f(L_Kr)^2-Kf_1r(fr'+f_1r/2)+K^2fr^2\right]dx.
\]
The accepted primitive calculus gives `f'=f₁`, `f₁'=-2K`,
`f(0)=f(1)=0`, and `f₁(0)=2`, `f₁(1)=-2`.

The new native factorization is

\[
 A_K(r)=\int_0^1\left[f(L_Kr)^2+\frac12ff_1K'r^2\right]dx. \tag{1}
\]
Indeed, the original density minus the right-hand density is the actual
derivative of `-K f f₁ r²/2`. Its endpoint values vanish because `f` vanishes,
without a condition on either endpoint value or derivative of `r`.
All terms are continuous and integrable. Neither (1) nor the Green identity
below requires positive curvature; positivity enters the normalization and
stationarity converse.

The actual Green flux is

\[
 G_K(r,s)=f^2(r's-rs'),\qquad
 G_K(r,s)'=f(L_Kr)s-fr(L_Ks).
\]
It vanishes at both endpoints for **all** smooth probes. Thus `L_K` is symmetric
for the weighted pairing `∫f r s`. Applying this identity to (1) gives

\[
 E_Kr=L_K(L_Kr)+\frac12f_1K'r,\qquad
 A_K(r)=\int_0^1frE_Kr. \tag{2}
\]
The exact variation, with the actual derivatives of `r+ts`, is

\[
 A_K(r+ts)=A_K(r)+2t\int_0^1fsE_Kr+t^2A_K(s). \tag{3}
\]
Consequently its parameter derivative at zero is `2∫f s E_Kr`.
This retains the full curvature potential; replacing the action by its leading
square alone would lose a term.

For `K>0` on `[0,1]`, the accepted concavity argument gives `f>0` in `(0,1)`.
The new stationarity theorem proves the equivalence

\[
 \left[\frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0}A_K(r+ts)=0
       \text{ for every globally smooth }s\right]
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad E_Kr=0\text{ on }[0,1]. \tag{4}
\]
For the forward implication, take the legitimate smooth test `s=E_Kr`.
Its weighted-square integral is zero; continuity and positive interior weight
force `E_Kr=0` in the interior and then at the endpoints. This is an equivalence
for a **supplied smooth probe**, not an existence theorem for a nonzero kernel
or a proof that a joint optimizer exists.

Writing `q=L_Kr`, the endpoint values in (4) give

\[
 4q'(0)-K(0)q(0)+K'(0)r(0)=0,\qquad
 -4q'(1)-K(1)q(1)-K'(1)r(1)=0. \tag{5}
\]
These are consequences of the smooth equation. They are not asserted to be a
sufficient boundary-domain description for arbitrary singular solutions of the
fourth-order ODE. The leading coefficient of `E_K` is `f²`, which degenerates
at both poles; that distinction matters for any later spectral or compactness
argument.

If `r` is nonzero somewhere in `(0,1)`, the new positivity theorem gives
`m=∫f r²>0`. The explicit positive rescaling `c=1/√m` satisfies

\[
 \int_0^1f(cr)^2=1,\qquad A_K(cr)=c^2A_K(r). \tag{6}
\]
This establishes a legitimate scalar normalization and preserves action sign
and zero action. It does not manufacture a nonzero critical probe. General
metric-scale normalization and the completed operator domain are separate
obligations before a universal threshold reduction.

## Original objects and pole scope

The existing `RotationalOneForms` producer permits every globally smooth height
probe, and `RotationalInvariantClassification` supplies globally smooth probes
for every original invariant smooth form. The forms vanish at the poles because
the geometric covectors vanish there; the scalar probes need not vanish.
The accepted smooth area inverse and `AreaGeometricRealization` construct actual
original metric/profile/probe data with the closed-interval coordinate equations
and actual first and second derivative laws. No singular angular coordinate or
independently supplied jets occur in the new packet.

The new `AreaVariationGeometry` consumers explicitly retain the same `D.metric`,
`D.meridionalOneForm`, height primitive, and physical equations

\[
 D.a(V_K(x))=1/K(x),\quad R(V_K(x))=r(x),\quad S(V_K(x))=s(x)
 \qquad(0\leq x\leq1).
\]
They prove the original dissipation version of (2), and

\[
 \frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0}Q_{g_D}(M_D(R+tS))
   =4\pi\int_0^1fsE_Kr. \tag{7}
\]
The metric is fixed throughout this variation. These are consumers of the
accepted tying equations, whose producer remains available; they do not rename
a scalar action as a geometric object.
The accepted Haar reduction and nonnegative nonzonal remainder remain unchanged.
No new universal positivity claim, extension to all positively curved surfaces,
or exhaustive normalized-area parametrization theorem is asserted here.

The [source-bound Round 0 native gate](../evidence/phase2-round-0-final/receipt.json)
passed: three new modules were freshly elaborated; 149 unchanged phase-I source
elaborations were reused with verified hashes. The root aggregate, unsuppressed
declaration linters, exact signatures and actual transitive axiom closure passed
for 152 modules and 2,449 defining-module declarations, including 801 private
ones. Only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` occur in the checked
closures. The new packet has 19 public theorems and three actual operator/flux
definitions. Independent acceptance is pending the configured fresh outer reviewer. These notes are
separate from the accepted phase-I manuscript; its TeX and PDF are unchanged.

## Historical tools: bounded audit outcome

The supplied frozen historical tree does not contain
`ConnectionGlobalCalibrationRigidity.lean` or `ConnectionProjectedSFSRigidity.lean`.
Their exact statements and dependency closures remain unassessed. Missing files
are an evidence limitation, not a refutation of their contents. No old theorem
is imported into the new native packet.

The available downstream sources contain substantive results, with explicit
remaining premises:

- `ConnectionSmoothMeridianGeometricRealization.ClosedSphereZonalSafe` states
  universal nonnegativity of the original smooth meridional action in a curvature
  box. Its recovery consumer transports that supplied safety statement through
  genuine smooth geometric realization.
- `ConnectionPhysicalFiniteMeridianAssembly.action_glue` proves additive action
  from actual transported jets and interval telescoping. The final activity
  consumer still takes sphere safety, a coordinatized assembly for the relevant
  histories, an opposite completion and a zero-action pair. It does not produce
  a critical optimizer or global safety from a numerical branch.
- `FullBalancedBernsteinThreshold` has an endpoint-safety argument for its
  exhaustive negative-witness threshold. The final connection-identification
  theorem in `RotationalAllOneFormThreshold` requires candidate safety and
  failure of every larger cap. Equating that threshold with a candidate ratio
  under those assumptions does not evaluate the ratio.
- `ConnectionProjectedFeedback` proves a pointwise clamp maximization law.
  `ConnectionPhysicalHamiltonianReduction` needs strict physical concavity and
  actual coefficient/maximization identities. On its positive branch, the
  inspected strict-concavity condition is equivalent to `costate_N < -R/2`.
  The clamp algebra does not supply that sign or a fixed number of contacts.
- The available Bregman/Picone and active-costate leaves require their stated
  sign, zero-defect or endpoint-variation realization hypotheses. They are
  useful conditional tools, not an established global original-action calibration.

This is source-level research inventory. The historical manifest labels those
bytes unverified; current phase-I receipts are not compiler or transitive-axiom
evidence for the historical tree. The new packet uses only current accepted
native dependencies.

## Exact frontier and next target

No value, uniquely selected branch, smooth optimizer, relaxed optimizer, or
endpoint-attainment statement for `C_rot` has been established by this round.
In particular, (4) is necessary smooth fixed-geometry analysis; it does not prove
that its stationary probes minimize the action or that stationary geometries
are globally optimal. The possibility of polar concentration is still open.

The next executable target is the **curvature first variation of the original
six-entry action with a fixed smooth probe**, retaining both zero moment
constraints on the curvature variation `ξ`. The actual primitive variations are

\[
 \delta f(x)=-2\int_0^x(x-t)\xi(t)\,dt,\qquad
 \delta f_1(x)=-2\int_0^x\xi(t)\,dt.
\]
Derive its true moment-constrained switching density before assuming a sign or
finite contact pattern. Then test whether the required optimizer-specific signs
are consequences or additional unproved hypotheses. A nonsmooth route must
work with the original derivative-free-in-curvature action or justify every
interface term: formula (1) alone cannot be applied to a bounded measurable
curvature by interpreting `K'` as zero at jumps.

The full solution still requires truthful compactness/relaxation and nonzero
normalization control, any selection/uniqueness property used in a determining
characterization, global comparison over **all** original competitors, sharp
smooth recovery above the threshold, the exact endpoint statement, and native
and independent evidence for every claimed result.
